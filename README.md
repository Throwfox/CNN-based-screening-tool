# CNN-Based Automatic Screening Tool for Cardiovascular Diseases

This repository is the official implementation of [Convolutional neural network-based automatic screening tool for cardiovascular diseases using different intervals of ECG signals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721001103?dgcid=author), published in Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine. Feel free to contact me via this email (haodai@ufl.edu) if you have any problems.


### Guideline:
We simply implement our method based on the latest ECG datasets (PTB-XL), rather than PTB used in the original paper.
Accordingly, we adopt the full-length 10s ECG instead of one-second segments ECG
